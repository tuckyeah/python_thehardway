	You're a contestant on a new kind of dating game. You are
	placed in a room with two-three doors, each door representing some
	quality of the person waiting at the end of the maze. Follow
	your heart to find your true love!
	
	The game will have text outputs that present the user with choices
	and there are no 'wrong' choices - any combination will lead you to
	one of three possible contestants. 
	
	The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms
	Each room will print its own description and a description of the doors
	and then it will tell the engine which room to run next out of the
	map/tree.

Final Contestants: Dana Scully, Marilyn Manson, Ryan Gosling

1st room: Male / Female
2nd room: Ideal date?
3rd room: What kind of dessert would you most like?
4th room: 

--- OR ---

You wake up locked in a single room, with just a desk and a bed. You have no 
idea how you got here, and now you have to escape! The game will have
four or five rooms, each with a puzzle to be solved in order to progress.
Certain actions will result in the user's death.

The actions available to you will be similar to text style adventure games (look, walk, etc)
Each room will print its description and then prompt the user to explore.
Once the puzzle is solved, it will tell the engine which room to go to next.

The ENGINE will also randomly select the next room - so we have a set start room
(bedroom) and set end room (ornate), but the rooms in between can come in any order
Descriptions of each scene:

Bedroom: This is the starting point, and the user has to find the key hidden
in the desk to unlock the door.

KoiPond: User has to enter the right door - the same number as the number
of fish in the pond.

Library: The user has to find the name of the correct book written
on a piece of paper to reveal the next door.

Basement Passage: The user is blocked by a giant Turtle who asks a riddle.
The user must guess correctly to proceed. Or he makes them guess a number?

Ornately Decorated Room: The final room. To be free of this place once
and for all, the user has three chances to roll two die and have them
be doubles.

Death: A few rooms have ways to die, and this is where it tells them as much
and directs them back to the start or to the room they just left.

Save state (?): Maybe save the players state? If this isn't too hard?
