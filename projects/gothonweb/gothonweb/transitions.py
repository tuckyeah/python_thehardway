#CENTRAL CORRIDOR

cc_initial_description = """
The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed
your entire crew. You are the last survivng member and your last
mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow the ship up after getting into an 
escape pod.

You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when
a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume
flowing around his hate-filled body. He's blocking the door to the 
Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.
"""

shoot_transition = """
Quick on the draw, you yank out your blaster and fire it at the Gothon.
His clown costume is flowing and moving around his body, which throws
off your aim. Your laser hits his costume but misses him entirely. This
completely ruins his brand new costume his mother bought him, which
makes him fly into an insane rage and blast you repeatedly in the face until
you are dead. Then he eats you.
"""

dodge_transition = """
Like a world class boxer, you dodge, weave, slip and slide right
as the Gothon's blaster cranks a laser past your head.
In the middle of your artful dodge, your foot slips and you
bang your head on the metal wall and pass out.
You wake up shortly after only to die as the Gothon stomps on
your head and eats you.
